# CodeWars

Repo for practicing CodeWar katas and storing solutions. This will also include incomplete kata for me to go back to. Code is in Python unless otherwise stated. The code contains a link back to the kata in CodeWars.

## [3 Kyu](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars/tree/master/3kyu)

### [Alphabetic Anagrams](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars/blob/master/3kyu/alphabetic-anagrams.py)  
Assign a number to every 'word', based on where it falls in an alphabetically sorted list of all words made up of the same group of letters. There is a performance test to prevent coders using brute force (this is essentially a mathematical problem).

### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars/blob/master/3kyu/sudoku-solver.py)  
Solver for 'easy' (i.e. determinable) Sudokus.


## [4 Kyu](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars/tree/master/4kyu)

### [Hamming Numbers](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars/blob/master/4kyu/hamming-numbers.py) *in progress* 
Algorithm to generate Hamming Numbers, otherwise known as Natural Numbers. Have some working code, but it's too slow for CodeWars at the moment.

### [Ranking Poker Hands](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars/blob/master/4kyu/ranking-poker-hands.py)  
Fun challenge to rank poker hands in the format "AH 4C 7D 3C KS". Had already coded some of this years ago in Euler Problem 54, but the kata in CodeWars is to put the implementation in a class. Really enjoyed coding this.

### [Rail Fence Cipher](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars/blob/master/4kyu/rail-fence-cypher.py) 
The challenge is to encode and decode text using a fairly simple cipher that turns out to be a little harder to decode than I expected.
