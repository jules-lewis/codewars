# CodeWars

Repo for practicing CodeWar katas and storing solutions. This will also include incomplete kata for me to go back to. Code is in Python unless otherwise stated. The code contains a link back to the kata in CodeWars.

### [Ranking Poker Hands](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars/blob/master/4kyu/ranking-poker-hands.py)  
Fun challenge to rank poker hands in the format "AH 4C 7D 3C KS". Had already coded some of this years ago in Euler Problem 54, but the kata in CodeWars is to put the implementation in a class. Really enjoyed coding this.

### [Rail Fence Cipher](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars/blob/master/4kyu/rail-fence-cypher.py) (*incomplete*)  
The challenge is to encode and decode test using an outwardly simple cipher, but when I wrote a fairly simple implementation of the encode() function, realised I am going to struggle to decode! I want to give this some thought before I run off and simply look up the algorithm!
